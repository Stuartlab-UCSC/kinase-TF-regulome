For file derivations, see the Supplementary Methods of Roberston et. al (2017).
All files are in .listt format - each line begins with a regulator followed by all its targets in a tab-delimited manner.

Files:
kinase_targets.listt - kinase targets
tf_targets.listt - TF targets
tf_targets_filtered_min_15.listt - retains only TFs with >=15 targets from tf_targets.listt. This is the file used for all downstream analysis in Robertson et. al (2017).
